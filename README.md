## Kevin Docherty

In the spirit joie de vivre I like to continually challenge myself, whether professionally, intellectually, physically, or in simply tackling something new. My mantra is "to live to the max, continually challenge yourself to be the best you can be." Intellectually curious, I have studied engineering, geology, and geophysics, and also have a keen interest in economics, finance, and the markets.

Educational achievements include post-graduate qualifications in engineering and geophysics, as well a selection of MOOCs in mathematics, programming, data science, and machine learning. I'm excited and motivated by the intellectual challenge of solving technical problems, as well as the possibilities offered by working as a developer.
