## Kevin Docherty

In the spirit joie de vivre I like to continually challenge myself, whether professionally, intellectually, physically, or in simply tackling something new. My mantra is "to live to the max, continually challenge yourself to be the best you can be." Intellectually curious, I have studied engineering, geology, and geophysics, and also have a keen interest in economics, finance, and the markets.

Educational achievements include post-graduate qualifications in engineering and geophysics, as well a selection of MOOCs in mathematics, programming, data science, and machine learning. I'm excited and motivated by the intellectual challenge of solving technical problems, as well as the possibilities offered by working as a developer.

## Skills

**Analytical & Creative**

An aptitude for solving technical challenges, via logical process combined with lateral leaps of insight. 

I have successfully applied this approach to multiple projects with several employers, as well as in successfully tackling various courses / MOOCs.

**Numerate**

A natural aptitude and facility with numbers, applied in every role, but especially in my role as Capacity Planner at the BBC. During COVID lockdown, I also completed a MOOC in Mathematics for Machine Learning with Imperial College London.

**Presentational**

I developed skills of addressing an audience / public speaking during a stint of teaching physics in Reading and Basingstoke secondary schools.

**Reporting**

A natural facility with the written word, developed into strong reporting and presentational skills during various industry roles and various academic courses.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Nov 2022 - Feb 2023)
- Developer bootcamp offering exposure to Ruby, Git, TDD via RSpec, OOP, and other technologies.

#### University of Leeds (Oct 2010 to Oct 2011)

- MSc Exploration Geophysics.
- Investigation of the Earth's interior via acoustic (seismic), magnetic, and gravitational methods.

## Hobbies

A commitment to health and wellbeing and a keen gym-goer, but for sheer joy water-sports (water-ski, surf, swim) take some beating!
